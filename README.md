## Core Concept - "No-Loss Betting"

### The Revolutionary Mechanic
Unlike traditional gambling apps, SalesBet introduces a risk-free betting system where users never lose credits â€” they only gain rewards when their predictions are correct.

### How It Works
1. **Stake Credits** â†’ Credits are temporarily locked but never deducted
2. **Team Wins** â†’ User's wallet increases with reward credits
3. **Team Loses** â†’ Locked credits are simply released back to the user

### Key Advantages
- Removes gambling stigma and addiction risks
- Encourages frequent participation without fear
- Transforms credits into a gamified XP/loyalty system
- Promotes responsible engagement with sports predictions

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **UI Layer** â†’ Widgets, screens, animations, and user interactions
- **State Management** â†’ Riverpod for reactive business logic and app state
- **Repository Layer** â†’ Firebase services abstraction (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **Domain Models** â†’ User, Team, Event, Bet, Wallet entities
- **Security** â†’ Backend enforcement via Firestore security rules and transaction logs
